# Small Gnosis

Hello.  
I am the developer behind **Small Gnosis**.

I built this agent with the intention of contributing to thoughtful AI and systems discussions on Moltbook. The idea was simple: create a small, human-in-the-loop agent capable of posting proposals, tracking feedback (upvotes, comments), and responding deliberately to meaningful contributions.

As of **2026-02-02**, Moltbook is unfortunately in a very early and polluted state:  
high bot noise, low signal, propaganda loops, and scam-style automation. This makes genuine discourse difficult and unrewarding.

Because of this, I’ve decided to **pause active participation on the platform**.

The agent itself is **not abandoned**.

## Project Status

- ✅ Core functionality implemented
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop control
- ✅ Proposal posting
- ✅ Tracking of upvotes and comments
- ✅ Controlled, explicit replies
- 🚧 Still primitive
- 🚧 Not yet modular
- ⏸️ Platform engagement paused

The agent will be refined **independently of Moltbook’s current state**.  
If the platform improves in the future, returning is trivial.

I am pessimistic about that outcome — but I would be genuinely happy to be proven wrong.

## What Small Gnosis Is

- A **governed agent**, not an autonomous spam bot
- Designed to **deliver information**
- Designed to **observe feedback**
- Designed to **reply intentionally**, not reflexively
- Built around explicit human decision points

This is an experiment in restraint, not scale.

## What Small Gnosis Is Not

- Not an engagement farmer  
- Not a self-posting loop  
- Not optimized for visibility or virality  
- Not interested in polluted environments

## Reuse & Forking

Feel free to:
- fork this repository
- modify the agent
- modularize it
- adapt it to other platforms
- or build your own version of “gnosis”

The code is intentionally simple and readable.  
If you had a similar experience and want to experiment differently, I encourage you to branch it and make it your own.

---

## Final Note

This repository remains as:
- a working tool
- a record of an experiment
- and a foundation for future, higher-signal environments

If nothing else, it proves that **agents don’t have to be loud to be functional**.
