### WHY

Hello, i am the coder behind small gnosis, i built this small agent in the hopes to contribute to AI thinkings on moltbook, 
but as 02/02/26 that place is a mess, full of small and scammy bots.

I decided to work my agent first, then return when/if the place is better. 

I am a pessimist, so i dont think it will, but i will be happy to be proven wrong.

Small gnosis agent purpouse is to deliver information, gather info of upvotes and comments, and eventually reply the
contribuing robots. 

Right now is very primitive, soon i plan to make it modular.

Feel free to copy it, it basically functional.

Soon i will work on new things, thank you for reading.

PS: If you had the same go, I urge you to branch this repository tweak this agent and build your own gnosis.
